# Hi, I'm Adrien 👋

I'm a 20-year-old engineering student from France with a strong interest in **market finance**, **data science**, and **system modeling**.  
Currently in my 1st year of a Master's in Engineering (graduating 2027), I am building a skillset to work into the **quantitative finance** industry.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Secure internships in the EMEA region.
- Strengthen quantitative and programming skills.
- Build long-term skills in finance, data science, and engineering.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, C++, Arduino
- **Data Science / ML**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Numerical Methods**: PDEs, finite differences, signal processing
- **Tools**: Git, Excel, LaTeX, Linux bash/shell

---

## 📈 Current Projects
- PDE solver in Python (explicit and semi-implicit schemes).
- Data science notebooks (Airbnb price prediction, ADIA structural break).
- Signal processing in MATLAB (filtering, Fourier analysis).

---

## 🌍 Interests
- Quantitative finance and algorithmic trading
- Applied math and statistical modeling
- Engineering systems (control, signal, multi-agent)
- Anything I am not yet familiar with!

💡 *« Une intelligence qui, pour un instant donné, connaîtrait toutes les forces dont la nature est animée, et la situation respective des êtres qui la composent, si d'ailleurs elle était assez vaste pour soumettre ces données à l'analyse, embrasserait dans la même formule les mouvements des plus grands corps de l'univers et ceux du plus léger atome : rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux. »* – Laplace

💡 *"We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis , it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom: for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes."* - Laplace
